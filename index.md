## Project Report

### Example 1
![Example image 1 for car design](/assets/car1.png)

#### Pros:
- Has buttons for quick access
  - Temperature control
  - Air control
  - Sound control
- Notification is displayed on screen when a problem occurs

#### Cons:
- MPH is not always displayed on main digital display
  - The screen also displays several other menus and hides MPH 
  - MPH should always be visible digitally 
- Center screen is small
  - Not good for displaying music album art
  - Items within a list sometimes need scrolling (recent contacts)


### Example 2

#### Pros:
- Large main screen to show more information
- Large middle screen with multitasking
  - GPS
  - Music
  - Phone calls
- Main controls are centered under screen for easier access

#### Cons:

### Example 3

#### Pros:
- Displays MPH digitally (also includes classic style speedometer)
- Both screens are wide enough to show important information to the user

#### Cons:
- Bottom screen for temperature, air speed, etc. is very small
  - This could easily be display with a knob like the previous designs
- The amount of information displayed can be distracting
  - A button for toggling only important information would be helpful


### Example 4
![Example image 4 for car design](/assets/car4.png)

#### Pros:
- Main dashboard clearly represents information
- Shows MPH and other important information on screen
- Center dashboard has physical buttons for shortcuts
- Simple layout for temperature controls

#### Cons:
- Center Dashboard uses apps for navigation
  - Too many menus
  - Takes too much time to use while driving
  - Distracting
- Hard to press digital buttons while driving


### Example 5
![Example image 5 for car design](/assets/car5.png)

#### Pros:
- MPG is always visible on main screen
- Many physical buttons for most commonly used features
- Only important apps are displayed on screen

#### Cons:
- Gas and temperature meters are not ideal
  - Both meters are oddly positioned
  - Gas is not easily readable in this shape, should be moved to bar chart
- There are several unused/unimportant buttons on center dashboard


### Most common features
#### Main Dashboard
- Digital MPH displayed on screen
- Fuel remaining
- Speedometer and tachometer are always visible
- Portion of dashboard is saved to display warnings or problems with the vehicle
- Tire pressure view

#### Center Dashboard
- Display
  - Time
  - Currently playing music
  - User Settings


### Most common controls
#### Main Dashboard
- Control for switching between display modes
  - MPG
  - Tire pressure
  - Service interval tracker
- Fuel efficiency switch (normal, eco, sport)

#### Center Dashboard
- Temperature controls
- Air controls with indicator for speed
- Music controls


### Most common mistakes
#### Main Dashboard
- Tachometer is not useful for a lot of automatic car users
  - Fuel consumption can be monitored with RPM, can be displayed digitally
- Digital MPH sometimes is not visible to the user when trying to view other information

#### Center Dashboard
- If screen is too big, physical buttons are often removed
  - The user will have to look towards the screen to find the digital button they want to use
- If screen is too small, important info cannot be displayed to user easily
- Knobs are easier to use than buttons, switch, sliders, etc. for volume, temperature, and air flow


### How are we going to improve it
#### Main Dashboard
- Centering and giving a portion of the screen dedicated to alert icons
- Always showing MPH of vehicle
- Display fuel efficiency and fuel capacity in a horizontal bar
- Display text alerts for alert icon meaning

#### Center Dashboard
- Use physical buttons for screen shortcuts
- Use knobs for volume/temperature
- Display more information about alerts
